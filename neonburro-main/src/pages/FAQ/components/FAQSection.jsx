        },
        {
          q: 'Do you offer payment plans?',
          a: 'Absolutely! We typically work with a 50% deposit to start, with the remainder due at launch. For larger projects, we can arrange monthly payment plans. We want to make great web design accessible to businesses of all sizes.'
        },
        {
          q: 'What\'s included in the hourly packages?',
          a: 'Our "Fuel Up" hours can be used for anything: updates, new features, content changes, maintenance, consultations, or ongoing development. Buy hours in bulk and use them as needed - they never expire!'
        },
        {
          q: 'Are there any hidden fees?',

          q: 'How long does a typical project take?',
          a: 'Most websites launch within 4-8 weeks from kickoff. Simple sites can be done in 2-3 weeks, while complex e-commerce or custom applications may take 3-4 months. We\'ll give you a realistic timeline during consultation.'
        },
        {
          q: 'What\'s your design process?',
          a: 'We follow a proven 5-step process: Discovery (understanding your needs), Design (creating the visual direction), Development (building the site), Launch (going live), and Iterate (ongoing improvements based on real data).'
        },
        {
          q: 'How involved do I need to be?',
          a: 'As much or as little as you want! At minimum, we need your input during discovery and feedback on designs. Some clients love weekly check-ins, others prefer to let us run with it. You set the pace.'
        },
        {
          q: 'Can you work with our existing brand guidelines?',

        },
        {
          q: 'Will my site be mobile-friendly?',
          a: 'Every single site we build is mobile-first responsive. With over 60% of web traffic on mobile devices, it\'s not optional - it\'s essential. Your site will look amazing on everything from phones to ultrawide monitors.'
        },
        {
          q: 'Do you handle hosting and maintenance?',

        },
        {
          q: 'Is SEO included?',

        },
        {
          q: 'What if I don\'t like the design?',
          a: 'That\'s what revisions are for! Our process includes multiple feedback rounds. We won\'t move forward until you\'re thrilled with the direction. If we\'re really not clicking, we\'ll part ways amicably with a fair kill fee.'
        },
        {
          q: 'Can you help with content creation?',
