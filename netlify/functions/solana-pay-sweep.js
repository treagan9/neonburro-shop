// SENTINEL: NB_SHOP_SOLANA_SWEEP_V1
//
// The safety net for a closed tab. The browser polls solana-pay-status while
// the customer is looking at the QR, but a customer who sends the transfer
// from their phone and closes the laptop never polls again, and nobody would
// learn the money landed. This runs on a schedule (netlify.toml, every five
// minutes), walks every pending row that is not more than an hour past its
// expiry, and asks the chain. Anything found is settled and the yard is
// notified exactly as if the browser had asked. Anything long dead is marked
// expired so the table does not grow a tail.
//
// The browser cannot finalise the order for a customer who has gone, so for
// these the notification email IS the order. The row carries the items and
// whatever contact they left. If they left nothing and the goods are digital,
// there is nothing to send and that is what they chose. If they left nothing
// and something needs to ship, hello@ has a paid order with no address and a
// human decides.
//
// No oxford commas, no em dashes.
