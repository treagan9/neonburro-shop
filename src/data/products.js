    story: 'The Mystery T collection was born from a single question: what if clothing could hold stories the way skin holds scars? Each design emerged from a different moment of transition—autumn spiraling into winter, dawn bleeding into dusk, chaos finding its center. We collaborated with artists who work in the space between seasons, between states of being. The result is eleven designs that refuse to be just one thing. They shift. They evolve. They carry whatever energy you bring to them. Some customers say the patterns look different depending on their mood. We believe them. These are not mass-produced prints. Each one is a small portal, a wearable mystery that invites you to step through and see what you find on the other side.',
